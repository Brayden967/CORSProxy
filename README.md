CORSProxy
==========

A simple forward proxy server for processing API calls to servers that don't send CORS headers or support HTTPS. Forked from https://github.com/Freeboard/thingproxy

### CORSProxy vs Thingproxy

CORSProxy is a fork of Thingproxy with additional documentation + in-deph configuration that will be maintained. 

### What is the point of CORSProxy

CORSProxy allows your site to access resources on other domains that would normally be blocked due to the same-origin policy. It acts as a proxy between your browser and a remote server and adds the proper CORS headers to the response.

### how?

Just prefix any url with http(s)://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/

For example:

```
https://thingproxy.freeboard.io/fetch/http://my.api.com/get/stuff
```

Any HTTP method, headers and body you send, will be sent to the URL you specify and the response will be sent back to you with the proper CORS headers attached.

### caveats

Don't abuse the thingproxy.freeboard.io serverâ€” it is meant for relatively small API calls and not as a proxy server to hide your identity. Right now we limit requests and responses to 100,000 characters each (sorry no file downloads), and throttle each IP to 10 requests/second.

### privacy

thingproxy.freeboard.io does log the date, requester's IP address, and URL for each request sent to it. We do not log headers or request bodies. We will not share or sell this data to anyone, period.
